1. Make the basic layout, 2 buttons, the canvas and the shapes
2. The data structure would be an array of objects, with objects having properties such as:
-> Width
-> Height
-> Color
-> x-coord
-> y-coord

3. Movement of the shapes will happen once the user click, drags and releases to a new location inside the canvas. Update the corresponding object accordingly.

4. To export the design, serialize the array of object and send.

5. FW used: React JS
